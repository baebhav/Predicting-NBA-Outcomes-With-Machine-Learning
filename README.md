# Predicting-NBA-Outcomes-With-Machine-Learning
This project was my first experience with machine learning. After gaining an introduction to Python, pandas, and sci-kit learn, I wanted to apply my new knowledge to a topic that I had an interest in and contained a large amount of publicly available data. I've loved playing and watching basketball since I was a kid, so creating a machine learning model to predict the outcome of NBA games satisfied both of the above criteria. Luckily, I was able to download a large amount of data from basketball-reference.com for model building. As I've learned about data science, 90% of my time consisted of cleaning and curating these datasets into forms that the models could work with. I developed SQL and Excel VBA scripts that calculated and aggregated numerical metrics and statistics for NBA teams. Using this data, I built a regression model that predicted the probability of team winning a game given the team and opponent's performance metrics.
